                <img class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4 d-block article-image" src="../img/insectWing.jpg">
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vertebrates are often attributed for their ability to fly: birds, mammals (bats), and
                    other animals all took to the skies, with modified forelimbs serving as wings. But,
                    spare a thought for insects, which evolved flight only once and never looked
                    back. Insects are considered the first animals to fly, and they are considered the
                    best at it. The intricate mechanism of their wing muscles is a wonder in itself.
                    Evolution usually works with what it has: new body structures don’t pop-up out of
                    nowhere. But, in the case of insects it is not very clear whether they used
                    modified limbs or, arguably developed a brand new transformation in their
                    physiology. This is very unusual and there’s still not a strong scientific
                    consensus about it. Over the years, various theories have popped up supporting
                    two totally different ideas:</p>
                <br>
                <p>1. WINGS DEVELOPED AS NOVEL STRUCTURES:</p>
                <br>
                <p>The theory of the emergence of wings as novel structures has gained much
                    importance in the past. However, the tissue that gave rise to this novel and
                    evolutionarily crucial structure, and the mechanism that facilitated its evolution
                    are still under intensive debate. Just like legs, wings are found only on the
                    thoracic segments - suggesting that Hox genes limit the expression of wing
                    organiser genes. The insect body plan has three thoracic segments - T1, T2, and
                    T3. Of these, only T2 and T3 build wings. Tomoyasu Labs, Miami’s analyses also
                    uncovered detailed Hox regulation of abdominal wing serial homologs, which can
                    be used as a foundation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that have
                    facilitated the evolution of bona fide insect wings, as well as the diversification of
                    other wing serial homologs. They found that the formation of ectopic wings in the
                    abdomen upon homeotic transformation relies not only on the previously
                    identified abdominal wing serial homolog (gin-trap) but also on a secondary
                    tissue in the pleural location. Using an enhancer trap line of nubbin (a wing
                    lineage marker), they were able to visualise both of these two tissues (of tergal
                    and pleural nature) contributing to form a complete wing. </p>
                <br>
                <p>2. EVOLUTION THEORY:</p>
                <br>
                <p>In the first half of the 20th century, there were two main theories for the origin of
                    flight in insects, the ‘ flying squirrel ’ and ‘flying fish’ theories:</p>
                <br>
                <p>A).Insects are cold-blooded animals; they need heat from outside to warm
                    themselves up and hence love to sunbathe. They often bask in the sun, and
                    maybe in the past, one individual developed small flaps on it’s back to help soak
                    up the rays. Purely by chance, these flaps might have helped the insects to get
                    carried by the wind. Perhaps, the panels then evolved into a more aerodynamic
                    shape, eventually becoming wings. Although this theory seems fascinating, it is
                    improbable that this happened because the joints and muscles of an insect are
                    very complex structures for them to be evolved by such an evolutionary change
                    on scales.</p>
                <br>
                <p>B).Many insects spend the first part of their lives submerged in water. They
                    breathe through gills which bend and pump themselves to take in Oxygen. It is
                    thought it was gills like these that were developed into wings. It is believed that
                    an ancient insect might have waved its gills to catch the wind and set sail. Gills
                    already had the joints muscles to flap up and down and could then eventually
                    have evolved from sails to wings.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>Although all such theories attempt to explain insect wings’ evolution, they still are
                    not competent enough to draw a conclusion. While their origin seems almost "out
                    of the blue," careful developmental and paleontological studies in the future can
                    reveal the real reason behind such a fantastic physiological change in these
                    small creatures.</p>
