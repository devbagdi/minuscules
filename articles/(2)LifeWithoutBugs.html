                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s think of a hypothetical world
                    with no arthropods around. The first thought to many would be “Glad those gross
                    little creatures won’t haunt anymore!” There would no longer be mosquitoes biting,
                    no house flies buzzing, no diseases like malaria,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue" target="_blank"> dengue fever</a> and no need of
                    insecticides. Sounds good, right? But while giving it a second thought, we may
                    realise that these little creatures do many good deeds for us squeamish humans.
                    There is no two-way answer to this situation. The only thing that will happen
                    is that the world would fall apart without them. Life will not be able to survive
                    for more than a few years after the complete disappearance of arthropods.
                    The questions popping inside our brains might be “WHY!?” and “HOW!?”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Arthropods play a monumental, yet widely unappreciated role in the ecosystem. They are an important part of the food chain, not only for the adventure lovers who eat beetles, crickets and grasshoppers, but also for most other animal species. Approximately, 80% of all Earth plants are angiosperms and most of the food for humans and other animals comes from these flowering plants. 75% of angiosperms are pollinated by insects. Therefore, supply of a lot of food resources would hinder in the absence of entomophily. Also, most non-marine food chains depend on insects. Almost all birds eat insects, and even those that eat seeds as adults still feed insects to their young. It takes 200,000 insects to raise a swallow chick to adulthood. Without any insects at all, most bird and amphibian species would be extinct in two months. But the situation gets worse! There would be dead trees, animal carcasses and human bodies around that would take years to decay. Although there would still be bacteria and fungi, insects are also a huge part of the decomposing process; therefore, decomposition would take much longer. Just imagine piles and piles of dead things. Gross, right?</p>
                <br>
                <p>What else? There would be no honey, no moth silk, no lac, no spider silk, no dye, and the list continues! One of the most hated insects: Cockroaches, are helping scientists resolve antibiotic resistance. They love shit! They live in some of the filthiest areas although they themselves are very clean, and so they have developed a resistance to many infections. Instead of looking at plants and fungi for new cures, scientists are finally starting to look at insects.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Human brains easily understand the value of things when put in terms of money. So let’s think of it that way. A study by Losey and Waughan in 2006 reveals that the value of ecosystem services rendered by “wild” insects in the United States (excluding domesticated insects like honeybees and insects used in applied biological control) is estimated to be almost $60 billion a year, which is only a fraction of the value for all the services insects provide.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Fun fact is that if humans went extinct tomorrow, nothing too much would happen to the planet, but insect extinction could be cataclysmic. Bug extinction is scary because you don’t notice it until it’s too late. Now you may realise, that if such a condition does arise, then that might REALLY be “The End Game!”</p>

                        <p>Pandemic, a word which we all are familiar with now. Pandemics have happened as early as 3000 BC (of which we have a record of). Humans know how to prevent and treat diseases. We have a vast knowledge of many diseases, and we are continually trying to learn more. But what about insects?</p>
