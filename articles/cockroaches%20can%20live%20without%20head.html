                <p class="para"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b >T</b>o most of the people out there, cockroaches are already very revulsive and creepy organisms. After knowing the fact that it can live for several days without a head, it definitely makes one’s skin crawl! Well, there are several reasons that this little creature can survive without head and we can’t.
</p>
                <br>
                <p>The very first thing that may strike our mind by reading head being chopped off is: why the cockroach doesn’t bleed to death? The answer to this is that, unlike humans, cockroaches have an open circulatory system, which means they have a system for distributing blood through their bodies that doesn’t depend on a closed network of arteries and veins. Their blood doesn’t pump under pressure like ours. Hence, even when the head is cut-off, blood would not be forced out, and a clot would be formed around the neck. 
</p>
                <br>
                <p>The second thing is why the cockroach won’t suffocate to death? Well, again, unlike humans, cockroaches do not have a fixed organ for breathing. Rather, they breathe through the small pores, called spiracles, that don’t need a brain to direct them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The next thing is how cockroach manages to live without a brain? Yes, cockroaches do have a brain and they use them! However, they don’t need it that much. Cockroaches have nerve tissues that control reflexes throughout their bodies, and these are distributed within each body segment. Thus, even if the roach loses its brain, the nervous tissues around the body continue doing their job. These little devilish creatures would move around as normally as they do with the head.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of
                    the night. It’s also a unique complex process that can be very beneficial as well.</p>

                the process that the oxygen involved in the reaction comes in a special form called a
                superoxide anion, which basically is an oxygen atom with an extra electron. When this
                superoxide anion combines with calcium, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#:~:text=Adenosine%20triphosphate%20(ATP)%20is%20an,condensate%20dissolution%2C%20and%20chemical%20synthesis." target="_blank">adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</a> and the
                chemical <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin" target ="_blank">luciferin in the presence of luciferase (a bioluminescent enzyme) light is
                produced.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A firefly controls the beginning and end of the chemical reaction by regulating the
                    airflow into the abdomen to create a pulsating pattern, and thus the start and stop of its
                    light emission, by adding oxygen to the other chemicals needed to produce light. This
                    happens in the insect's light organ. When oxygen is available, the light organ lights up,
                    and visa versa. Fireflies appear to light up for a variety of reasons. Fireflies produce
                    defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use
                    their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness towards a
                    potential danger. As adults, many fireflies have flash patterns unique to their species
                    and use them to identify other members of their species as well as to discriminate
                    between members of the opposite sex. Thus, their bioluminescence can be considered a
                    way of communication. Also, Unlike a light bulb, which produces a lot of heat in addition
                    to light, a firefly's light is "cold light" without a lot of energy being lost as heat. This is
                    necessary because if a firefly's light-producing organ got as hot as a light bulb, the firefly
                    would not survive the experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, Luciferin that is extractable from fireflies is a very important
                    compound, it is considered to have potential to be used in detection of specific enzymes
                    in the brains of living rats, which could someday offer doctors another window into the
                    human brain. Firefly luciferin is already proving to be a useful tool in imaging human
                    tumors and developing cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of
                    the night. It’s also a unique complex process that can be very beneficial as well.</p>

                the process that the oxygen involved in the reaction comes in a special form called a
                superoxide anion, which basically is an oxygen atom with an extra electron. When this
                superoxide anion combines with calcium, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#:~:text=Adenosine%20triphosphate%20(ATP)%20is%20an,condensate%20dissolution%2C%20and%20chemical%20synthesis." target="_blank">adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</a> and the
                chemical <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin" target ="_blank">luciferin in the presence of luciferase (a bioluminescent enzyme) light is
                produced.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A firefly controls the beginning and end of the chemical reaction by regulating the
                    airflow into the abdomen to create a pulsating pattern, and thus the start and stop of its
                    light emission, by adding oxygen to the other chemicals needed to produce light. This
                    happens in the insect's light organ. When oxygen is available, the light organ lights up,
                    and visa versa. Fireflies appear to light up for a variety of reasons. Fireflies produce
                    defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use
                    their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness towards a
                    potential danger. As adults, many fireflies have flash patterns unique to their species
                    and use them to identify other members of their species as well as to discriminate
                    between members of the opposite sex. Thus, their bioluminescence can be considered a
                    way of communication. Also, Unlike a light bulb, which produces a lot of heat in addition
                    to light, a firefly's light is "cold light" without a lot of energy being lost as heat. This is
                    necessary because if a firefly's light-producing organ got as hot as a light bulb, the firefly
                    would not survive the experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, Luciferin that is extractable from fireflies is a very important
                    compound, it is considered to have potential to be used in detection of specific enzymes
                    in the brains of living rats, which could someday offer doctors another window into the
                    human brain. Firefly luciferin is already proving to be a useful tool in imaging human
                    tumors and developing cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of
                    the night. It’s also a unique complex process that can be very beneficial as well.</p>

                the process that the oxygen involved in the reaction comes in a special form called a
                superoxide anion, which basically is an oxygen atom with an extra electron. When this
                superoxide anion combines with calcium, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#:~:text=Adenosine%20triphosphate%20(ATP)%20is%20an,condensate%20dissolution%2C%20and%20chemical%20synthesis." target="_blank">adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</a> and the
                chemical <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin" target ="_blank">luciferin in the presence of luciferase (a bioluminescent enzyme) light is
                produced.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A firefly controls the beginning and end of the chemical reaction by regulating the
                    airflow into the abdomen to create a pulsating pattern, and thus the start and stop of its
                    light emission, by adding oxygen to the other chemicals needed to produce light. This
                    happens in the insect's light organ. When oxygen is available, the light organ lights up,
                    and visa versa. Fireflies appear to light up for a variety of reasons. Fireflies produce
                    defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use
                    their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness towards a
                    potential danger. As adults, many fireflies have flash patterns unique to their species
                    and use them to identify other members of their species as well as to discriminate
                    between members of the opposite sex. Thus, their bioluminescence can be considered a
                    way of communication. Also, Unlike a light bulb, which produces a lot of heat in addition
                    to light, a firefly's light is "cold light" without a lot of energy being lost as heat. This is
                    necessary because if a firefly's light-producing organ got as hot as a light bulb, the firefly
                    would not survive the experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, Luciferin that is extractable from fireflies is a very important
                    compound, it is considered to have potential to be used in detection of specific enzymes
                    in the brains of living rats, which could someday offer doctors another window into the
                    human brain. Firefly luciferin is already proving to be a useful tool in imaging human
                    tumors and developing cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of
                    the night. It’s also a unique complex process that can be very beneficial as well.</p>

                the process that the oxygen involved in the reaction comes in a special form called a
                superoxide anion, which basically is an oxygen atom with an extra electron. When this
                superoxide anion combines with calcium, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#:~:text=Adenosine%20triphosphate%20(ATP)%20is%20an,condensate%20dissolution%2C%20and%20chemical%20synthesis." target="_blank">adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</a> and the
                chemical <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin" target ="_blank">luciferin in the presence of luciferase (a bioluminescent enzyme) light is
                produced.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A firefly controls the beginning and end of the chemical reaction by regulating the
                    airflow into the abdomen to create a pulsating pattern, and thus the start and stop of its
                    light emission, by adding oxygen to the other chemicals needed to produce light. This
                    happens in the insect's light organ. When oxygen is available, the light organ lights up,
                    and visa versa. Fireflies appear to light up for a variety of reasons. Fireflies produce
                    defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use
                    their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness towards a
                    potential danger. As adults, many fireflies have flash patterns unique to their species
                    and use them to identify other members of their species as well as to discriminate
                    between members of the opposite sex. Thus, their bioluminescence can be considered a
                    way of communication. Also, Unlike a light bulb, which produces a lot of heat in addition
                    to light, a firefly's light is "cold light" without a lot of energy being lost as heat. This is
                    necessary because if a firefly's light-producing organ got as hot as a light bulb, the firefly
                    would not survive the experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, Luciferin that is extractable from fireflies is a very important
                    compound, it is considered to have potential to be used in detection of specific enzymes
                    in the brains of living rats, which could someday offer doctors another window into the
                    human brain. Firefly luciferin is already proving to be a useful tool in imaging human
                    tumors and developing cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of
                    the night. It’s also a unique complex process that can be very beneficial as well.</p>

                the process that the oxygen involved in the reaction comes in a special form called a
                superoxide anion, which basically is an oxygen atom with an extra electron. When this
                superoxide anion combines with calcium, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#:~:text=Adenosine%20triphosphate%20(ATP)%20is%20an,condensate%20dissolution%2C%20and%20chemical%20synthesis." target="_blank">adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</a> and the
                chemical <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin" target ="_blank">luciferin in the presence of luciferase (a bioluminescent enzyme) light is
                produced.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A firefly controls the beginning and end of the chemical reaction by regulating the
                    airflow into the abdomen to create a pulsating pattern, and thus the start and stop of its
                    light emission, by adding oxygen to the other chemicals needed to produce light. This
                    happens in the insect's light organ. When oxygen is available, the light organ lights up,
                    and visa versa. Fireflies appear to light up for a variety of reasons. Fireflies produce
                    defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use
                    their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness towards a
                    potential danger. As adults, many fireflies have flash patterns unique to their species
                    and use them to identify other members of their species as well as to discriminate
                    between members of the opposite sex. Thus, their bioluminescence can be considered a
                    way of communication. Also, Unlike a light bulb, which produces a lot of heat in addition
                    to light, a firefly's light is "cold light" without a lot of energy being lost as heat. This is
                    necessary because if a firefly's light-producing organ got as hot as a light bulb, the firefly
                    would not survive the experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, Luciferin that is extractable from fireflies is a very important
                    compound, it is considered to have potential to be used in detection of specific enzymes
                    in the brains of living rats, which could someday offer doctors another window into the
                    human brain. Firefly luciferin is already proving to be a useful tool in imaging human
                    tumors and developing cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of
                    the night. It’s also a unique complex process that can be very beneficial as well.</p>

                the process that the oxygen involved in the reaction comes in a special form called a
                superoxide anion, which basically is an oxygen atom with an extra electron. When this
                superoxide anion combines with calcium, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#:~:text=Adenosine%20triphosphate%20(ATP)%20is%20an,condensate%20dissolution%2C%20and%20chemical%20synthesis." target="_blank">adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</a> and the
                chemical <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin" target ="_blank">luciferin in the presence of luciferase (a bioluminescent enzyme) light is
                produced.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A firefly controls the beginning and end of the chemical reaction by regulating the
                    airflow into the abdomen to create a pulsating pattern, and thus the start and stop of its
                    light emission, by adding oxygen to the other chemicals needed to produce light. This
                    happens in the insect's light organ. When oxygen is available, the light organ lights up,
                    and visa versa. Fireflies appear to light up for a variety of reasons. Fireflies produce
                    defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use
                    their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness towards a
                    potential danger. As adults, many fireflies have flash patterns unique to their species
                    and use them to identify other members of their species as well as to discriminate
                    between members of the opposite sex. Thus, their bioluminescence can be considered a
                    way of communication. Also, Unlike a light bulb, which produces a lot of heat in addition
                    to light, a firefly's light is "cold light" without a lot of energy being lost as heat. This is
                    necessary because if a firefly's light-producing organ got as hot as a light bulb, the firefly
                    would not survive the experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, Luciferin that is extractable from fireflies is a very important
                    compound, it is considered to have potential to be used in detection of specific enzymes
                    in the brains of living rats, which could someday offer doctors another window into the
                    human brain. Firefly luciferin is already proving to be a useful tool in imaging human
                    tumors and developing cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of
                    the night. It’s also a unique complex process that can be very beneficial as well.</p>

                    defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use
                    their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness towards a
                    potential danger. As adults, many fireflies have flash patterns unique to their species
                    and use them to identify other members of their species as well as to discriminate
                    between members of the opposite sex. Thus, their bioluminescence can be considered a
                    way of communication. Also, Unlike a light bulb, which produces a lot of heat in addition
                    to light, a firefly's light is "cold light" without a lot of energy being lost as heat. This is
                    necessary because if a firefly's light-producing organ got as hot as a light bulb, the firefly
                    would not survive the experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, Luciferin that is extractable from fireflies is a very important
                    compound, it is considered to have potential to be used in detection of specific enzymes
                    in the brains of living rats, which could someday offer doctors another window into the
                    human brain. Firefly luciferin is already proving to be a useful tool in imaging human
                    tumors and developing cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of
                    the night. It’s also a unique complex process that can be very beneficial as well.</p>

                the process that the oxygen involved in the reaction comes in a special form called a
                superoxide anion, which basically is an oxygen atom with an extra electron. When this
                superoxide anion combines with calcium, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#:~:text=Adenosine%20triphosphate%20(ATP)%20is%20an,condensate%20dissolution%2C%20and%20chemical%20synthesis." target="_blank">adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</a> and the

                <br>
                <p>A firefly controls the beginning and end of the chemical reaction by regulating the
                    airflow into the abdomen to create a pulsating pattern, and thus the start and stop of its
                    light emission, by adding oxygen to the other chemicals needed to produce light. This
                    happens in the insect's light organ. When oxygen is available, the light organ lights up,
                    and visa versa. Fireflies appear to light up for a variety of reasons. Fireflies produce
                    defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use
                    their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness towards a
                    potential danger. As adults, many fireflies have flash patterns unique to their species
                    and use them to identify other members of their species as well as to discriminate
                    between members of the opposite sex. Thus, their bioluminescence can be considered a
                    way of communication. Also, Unlike a light bulb, which produces a lot of heat in addition
                    to light, a firefly's light is "cold light" without a lot of energy being lost as heat. This is
                    necessary because if a firefly's light-producing organ got as hot as a light bulb, the firefly
                    would not survive the experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, Luciferin that is extractable from fireflies is a very important
                    compound, it is considered to have potential to be used in detection of specific enzymes
                    in the brains of living rats, which could someday offer doctors another window into the
                    human brain. Firefly luciferin is already proving to be a useful tool in imaging human
                    tumors and developing cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of

                produced.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A firefly controls the beginning and end of the chemical reaction by regulating the
                    airflow into the abdomen to create a pulsating pattern, and thus the start and stop of its
                    light emission, by adding oxygen to the other chemicals needed to produce light. This
                    happens in the insect's light organ. When oxygen is available, the light organ lights up,
                    and visa versa. Fireflies appear to light up for a variety of reasons. Fireflies produce
                    defensive steroids in their bodies that make them unpalatable to predators. Larvae use
                    their glows as warning displays to communicate their distastefulness towards a
                    potential danger. As adults, many fireflies have flash patterns unique to their species
                    and use them to identify other members of their species as well as to discriminate
                    between members of the opposite sex. Thus, their bioluminescence can be considered a
                    way of communication. Also, Unlike a light bulb, which produces a lot of heat in addition
                    to light, a firefly's light is "cold light" without a lot of energy being lost as heat. This is
                    necessary because if a firefly's light-producing organ got as hot as a light bulb, the firefly
                    would not survive the experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, Luciferin that is extractable from fireflies is a very important
                    compound, it is considered to have potential to be used in detection of specific enzymes
                    in the brains of living rats, which could someday offer doctors another window into the
                    human brain. Firefly luciferin is already proving to be a useful tool in imaging human
                    tumors and developing cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So the next time you see a firefly, keep in mind that its flickering isn’t just a wonder of
                    the night. It’s also a unique complex process that can be very beneficial as well.</p>
